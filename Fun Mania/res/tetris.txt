Decription :
The Tetris game requires players to 
strategically rotate, move, and drop a 
procession of Tetriminos that fall into 
the rectangular Matrix at increasing 
speeds. Players attempt to clear as many 
lines as possible by completing horizontal
rows of blocks without empty space, but if
the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the
game is over! It might sound simple, 
but strategy and speed can go a long 
way! Are YOU up for the challenge?

LEFT ARROW key to make the tetromino move
